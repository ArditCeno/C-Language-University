Adjacent Sum Finder — C Programming Exercise

A small C program that scans an integer array and detects whether any two consecutive elements have a sum equal to 12.

If such a pair exists, the program prints:

The matching values

Their positions in the array

Otherwise, it reports that no valid pair was found.

This project was built as a personal programming exercise to practice array traversal, conditional logic, and basic algorithmic thinking in C.

✨ Key Concepts Demonstrated

Array iteration

Adjacent element comparison

Conditional checks

Early program termination (return)

Console output formatting
